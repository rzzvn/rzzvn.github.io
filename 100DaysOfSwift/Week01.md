1. All numbers can be separated with _ for better visibility . The reason comma is not used is that it will clash with a lot of other syntaxes e.g. function calls

`let  var highScore = 328_556_2.22_2 // output 3285562.222`
2.  _CGFloat_ is actually a _typedef_ of _Double_. In 32 bit devices, CGFloat is actually a float, but for 64 bit devices (which almost all of the iPhones are), _CGFloat_ is a _Double_.
